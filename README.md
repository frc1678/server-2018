# 1678 Server 2018

This is a guideline for handling and contributing to the 2018 seasonâ€™s projects.

## 2018 Season Information
This year, the server was separated into two repositories, 'server-2018' and 'Scout-Manager-2018'
This was due to the creation of the new bluetooth system in 3 weeks and the new QR system implemented in 2 weeks.  There wasn't enough time to intergrate the new system into the server.

Scout-Manager runs both the bluetooth file transfer system and QR code system (Including missing data and diagnostic notifications).

## Style Guide

Use standard language code conventions. A basic guideline is [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
	
## Commit Guide

You should also make sure that you are writing good commit messages! Here are a couple articles on this: [1](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) [2](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Particularly, you should make sure to write your commits in the imperative mood ("Add somefeature", not "Added somefeature") and capitalize the first word. If the change is complicated, use multiple lines to describe it.

Additionally, you should try to make your commits as small as possible (often referred to as making "atomic" commits). This helps other people understand what you are doing.


## Contributing

Here's how to get your code into the main project repository:


### If you've just joined the team:

1. Make an account on GitHub.
2. Ask the App Programming lead to add your account to the frc1678 repositories.


### If it's the first time you contributed to a repo:

1. Fork the repo
  	+ Login to github and navigate to the repo.
  	+ Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the screen.
2. Clone your forked repo.
 	 + `git clone https://github.com/<your_name>/<repo_name>.git`, where `<your_name>` is your github username and `<repo_name>` is the project repository name (eg. scout-2017, server-2017).


### Keeping your fork up to date:

1. Add a remote for the upstream main repository you forked.
	* `git remote add upstream https://github.com/frc1678/<repo_name>`, where `<repo_name>` is the name of the app you are trying to update.
2. Whenever you want to update your fork with the latest updates on the main repository, fetch the upstream branches and merge the upstream remote's master into your local master branch.
	* `git fetch upstream` to fetch all the branches
	* `git branch -a` to see all the branches, both local and remote
	* `git checkout master` to checkout to your local branch master
	* `git merge remotes/upstream/master` to update your local branch master with the main repository's master branch
See [here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) for more information.


### Anytime you want to make a change:

1. Update your fork's master branch.
2. Create and checkout a new branch.
 	 * `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>`, where `<your-branch-name>` is a descriptive name for your branch. Use dashes in the branch name, not underscores.
3. Make whatever code changes you want/need/ to make. Be sure to test your changes!
4. Commit your work locally.
  	+ Try to make your commits as atomic (small) as possible. For example, moving functions around should be different from adding features, and changes to one subsystem should be in a different commit than changes to another subsystem.
 	 + Follow [these](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) conventions for commit messages.
 	 + If your change is anything more than a few lines or small fixes, don't skip the extended description. If you are always using git commit with the -m option, stop doing that.
See this [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9562304/github-commit-with-extended-message) for instructions on how to write an extended commit description.
5. Push to your forked repo.
 	 + `git push origin <your_branch_name>`.
6. Submit a pull request.
 	 1. Log into github.
 	 2. Go to the page for your forked repo.
 	 3. Select the branch that you just pushed from the "Branch" dropdown menu.
 	 4. Click "New Pull Request".
 	 5. Review the changes that you made.
 	 6. If you are happy with your changes, click "Create Pull Request".
 7. Wait
 	 + People must review (and approve of) your changes before they are merged.
  	 + Specifically, ***1 experienced student*** contributing to that project have to approve it
 	 + If there are any concerns about your pull request, fix them. Depending on how severe the concerns are, the pull request may be merged without it, but everyone will be happier if you fix your code. To update your PR, just push to the branch on your forked repo.
  	+ Don't dismiss someone's review when you make changes - instead, ask them to re-review it.
8. Merge your changes into master
	  + If there are no conflicts, push the "Squash and merge" button, write a good commit message, and merge the changes.
 	 + If there are conflicts, fix them locally on your branch, push them, and then squash and merge.


## Helpful Tips and Error solutions

### Other remotes

You can add "remotes" to github that refer to other people's code repos. This allows you to, for example, take a look at someone else's code to look over it. You would be able to `git checkout <name_of_person>/juicy-commit` to see it. To add a remote, just do `git remote add <name_of_person> https://github.com/<username>/<repo_name>.git`. Once you've done this, you can use `git fetch <name_of_person>` to get updated code from other people's repos!


### Server Programming Tips

If you have trouble doing something in python, or you don't understand the code, check [this](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/) out!

Also, to learn more about the server, check [this](https://goo.gl/gkbAEH) documentation out!

### No module named http_client

If you come across this error while trying to run the server or anything in the server that uses six, I have come across a solution which worked for me. In terminal, type in the following:
`export PYTHONPATH="/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages"`
That should work, but if it doesn't, then it should just be a pyrebase version problem. To fix that, simply make sure your pyrebase version, your code version, and all your other modules' and libraries' versions are the same.

### More help

If you need more help, and nothing here has worked for you, or what you need is not on here, contact a server programmer.
